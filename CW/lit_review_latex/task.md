Literature Review for Advanced Engineering Research Project Organization and Design
=========================

1. Background and motivation
---------------
Over the summer you will be undertaking a research focused project.  Most of you will be embedded in a research group or at the very least have a supervisor who is research active.  The goal of Scientific/Engineering in a University is to make a novel contribution to your field of study.  Before you can do this, you must first understand what others have done before in your filed, what a novel direction of research would be and where your potential project fits into this this picture.  In short, it is much better to spend time building on the work of others, than repeating work others have already done before.  Or as Newton said in 1676, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.", which means he only accomplished what he did by building on the work of others.

This literature review, task will enable you to develop the skills of searching the literature for the work of others, thinking about what you have found, and discussing what you have found in written text.  Furthermore, a key element of a literature review is identifying which questions still remain open within the field, what is well studied and what has not yet been studied.

When it comes time to perform a literature review as part of you dissertation, you will already have these skills well practiced.  This means that when you start your project, you will hit the ground running. If your work, based on a sound literature review and raises very interesting research questions, you may even be able to turn your dissertation into a published paper which would be very good for your CV.

2. The topic of the literature review
-------------------------------------
This literature review will be *on solar energy harvesting*, specifically turning the suns energy into a useful power source for man kind.  The way you approach the topic is up to you, for example if are doing an MSc in Electrical Engineering, you may want to focus on the challenges of running an electricity grid with a lot solar in it.  If your MSc is in Materials Science, you may want to focus on novel materials used in 3rd generation solar cells, or if your MSc is in the bio-sciences, you may want to focus on growing bio-mass to then burning bio-mass to generate energy.  The exact focus is up to you, but your review must extensively answer at least three of the following points.

 - Discuss the past and future cost harvesting of solar energy, and how these have/will changed over time.
 - Under what circumstances/where in the world does solar energy already out compete fossil fuels in terms of costs, how is this projected to change?
 - What types of solar technologies available, and how these have developed over time?
 - Upcoming and promising methods of harvesting the suns energy.
 - Predict how will the UKs electricity be produced in 20 years and why?
 - How solar energy can be stored for use at night.
 - When might we run out of coal and oil?


3. Learning Outcomes
--------------------

It is intended that you will demonstrate the following learning outcomes:

 - The ability to search the literature and other information sources for information/data relevant to a research topic.
 - Demonstrate the ability to identify and critically evaluate ideas related to your own project.
 - Write, a literature review in a structured and concise way.
 - Write scientific English
 - Use references.
 - Produce a well formatted document.

4. The format of the literature review
-------------------------------------
Document must contain

 - Abstract
 - Introduction
 - Discussion
 - Conclusion
 - References

The document must:
- Not be longer than 2 pages of text + up to a maximum of 1 page of references. (3 pages in total)
- 



Marking Scheme
This literature review is worth 50% of the H14POD module and will be marked out of 100.  You should give a comprehensive and critical background to the topic so that you can show your knowledge of the subject area.  You should acknowledge other people’s ideas and attribute them whilst demonstrating evidence for your own ideas as well as counter arguments where possible.  Don’t simply list ideas and results that others have published, compare contrast and analyze them.  By the end of this literature review, you should become an expert on the topic.
    • Report structure and format (10/100): Marks will be awarded for appropriate and correct structure.
    • Report writing & presentation (20/100): Marks will be awarded for presentation and readability with appropriate illustrations, a clearly defined introduction and conclusion, logical and fluent organisation of ideas in the body of the report, appropriate grammar, punctuation, spelling and language use.
    • Discussion (60/100): Marks will be awarded for clear identification of the field of study, critical evaluation of the selected technologies, clear evidence of extensive independent study and thinking, comparison and contrasting of the current literature found in a range of sources, demonstration of an ability to build a logical argument from the current literature.
    • Referencing (10/100): Marks will be awarded for appropriate and correct citation, research with relevant literature, use of multiple sources, acknowledgement in the text of all sources for ideas quoted, paraphrased or accessed.
Who will mark my literature review?
Your supervisor will mark your literature review, however I will moderate your supervisors marking to ensure consistency over the cohort.
Submission
You are to submit the literature review as a pdf file to to moodle not a docx or doc file.  If you upload an MS Word document and it does not open correctly on your supervisors tablet/laptop/PC, you could loose the presentation marks.  If  you upload the wrong file, or no file, or an empty file late marks late marks will be applied as usual.
