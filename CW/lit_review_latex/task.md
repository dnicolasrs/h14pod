Literature Review for Advanced Engineering Research Project Organisation and Design
=========================

1. Background and motivation
---------------
Over the summer you will be undertaking a research focused project.  Most of you will be embedded in a research group or at the very least have a supervisor who is research active.  The goal of Scientific/Engineering in a University is to make a novel contribution to your field of study.  Before you can do this, you must first understand what others have done before in your filed, what a novel direction of research would be and where your potential project fits into this this picture.  In short, it is much better to spend time building on the work of others, than repeating work others have already done before.  Or as Newton said in 1676, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.", which means he only accomplished what he did by building on the work of others.

This literature review, task will enable you to develop the skills of searching the literature for the work of others, thinking about what you have found, and discussing what you have found in written text.  Furthermore, a key element of a literature review is identifying which questions still remain open within the field, what is well studied and what has not yet been studied.

When it comes time to perform a literature review as part of you dissertation, you will already have these skills well practiced.  This means that when you start your project, you will hit the ground running. If your work, based on a sound literature review and raises very interesting research questions, you may even be able to turn your dissertation into a published paper which would be very good for your CV.

3. Learning Outcomes
--------------------

It is intended that you will demonstrate the following learning outcomes:

 - The ability to search the literature and other information sources for information/data relevant to a research topic.
 - Demonstrate the ability to identify and critically evaluate ideas related to your own project.
 - Write, a literature review in a structured and concise way.
 - Write scientific English
 - Use references.
 - Produce a well formatted document.

Resources
You will need:
    • One kick off meeting with your supervisor, where the topic of your project and literature review will be set.
Requirements
You are to write a 2,000 word (maximum) literature review including appropriate diagrams and illustrations on the topic of your project.  The word count does not include, the appendix, figure captions, or the reference list.  The review should include an:
    • Abstract or summary
    • Introduction
    • Discussion
    • Conclusion
    • References

Marking Scheme
This literature review is worth 50% of the H14POD module and will be marked out of 100.  You should give a comprehensive and critical background to the topic so that you can show your knowledge of the subject area.  You should acknowledge other people’s ideas and attribute them whilst demonstrating evidence for your own ideas as well as counter arguments where possible.  Don’t simply list ideas and results that others have published, compare contrast and analyze them.  By the end of this literature review, you should become an expert on the topic.
    • Report structure and format (10/100): Marks will be awarded for appropriate and correct structure.
    • Report writing & presentation (20/100): Marks will be awarded for presentation and readability with appropriate illustrations, a clearly defined introduction and conclusion, logical and fluent organisation of ideas in the body of the report, appropriate grammar, punctuation, spelling and language use.
    • Discussion (60/100): Marks will be awarded for clear identification of the field of study, critical evaluation of the selected technologies, clear evidence of extensive independent study and thinking, comparison and contrasting of the current literature found in a range of sources, demonstration of an ability to build a logical argument from the current literature.
    • Referencing (10/100): Marks will be awarded for appropriate and correct citation, research with relevant literature, use of multiple sources, acknowledgement in the text of all sources for ideas quoted, paraphrased or accessed.
Who will mark my literature review?
Your supervisor will mark your literature review, however I will moderate your supervisors marking to ensure consistency over the cohort.
Submission
You are to submit the literature review as a pdf file to to moodle not a docx or doc file.  If you upload an MS Word document and it does not open correctly on your supervisors tablet/laptop/PC, you could loose the presentation marks.  If  you upload the wrong file, or no file, or an empty file late marks late marks will be applied as usual.
